Problem 3b

input: 
    file -- contains 2 lines. The first one has an integer n.
    The second one has an ordering of the integers from 1 to n (see README). 
    delta -- bound for ranking significance.
output: Number of large inversions. 

TODO: implement a Î˜(n log n) as described in the homework.
